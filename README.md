DiffPatch [![DiffPatch NuGet version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/DiffPatch.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DiffPatch/)
========

Diff parsing and patching for .Net<br />
Target Platform : .Net Standard 2.0

Inspired by / Based on :
* [ParseDiff](https://github.com/jkingry/ParseDiff) (Unified Diff Parser in C#) by jkingry
* [sharpdiff](https://github.com/jagregory/sharpdiff) (Diff creation and parsing library for .Net) by jagregory

## Features
The main use is to patch files using unified diff file. Diff generation is not supported and I do not intend to add it.
I wrote this code to apply patches generated by other program (git diff, Linux diff, ...)
